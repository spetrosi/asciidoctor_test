# asciidoctor_test

This role runs asciidoctor to build AsciiDoc files into the HTML5-formatted output file.

## Role Variables

This role requires you to provide three variables:

### directory
Path where the AsciiDoc file that you want to build are stored.

### source_file
The filename of the AsciiDoc file that you want to build. For example, master.adoc.

### output_file

The module creates the output file in the directory where the source file is stored.

## Example of setting the variables:

```yaml
directory: "path/to/adoc/files"
source_file: "master.adoc"
output_file: "build.html"
```

## Example Playbook
